## Trust in male and female advisers: An experimental investigation

**Speaker**: [Marie-Pierre Dargnies](https://sites.google.com/view/mariepierredargnies/home), DRM-Finance

### Abstract

We use an online experiment to investigate advisers' recommendation follow-up and the choice of an adviser to receive a recommendation from. We are interested in the role of the adviser's gender and of whether the adviser is portrayed as an expert or not. Participants play the Monty Hall game, a decision game for which most participants have a false intuition about the expected payoff maximizing action. Before making the final decision determining whether they win the prize or not, each participant receives a recommendation from an adviser. For some participants, it is randomly determined whether they receive the recommendation of a male or a female adviser. In other conditions, participants must choose an adviser between two males and two females before receiving the recommendation from the chosen adviser. Advisers are either portrayed as experts or not. Presenting advisers as experts shifts the recommendation follow-up gender gap in favor of female advisers. In conditions where participants have to choose an adviser among several ones, female participants choose more often a female adviser. Men who chose a female adviser follow more often the recommendation than the ones who chose a male adviser

## Marketing and gender stereotypes: building a corpus of gendered products

**Speakers**: [Eva Delacroix-Bastien](https://drm.dauphine.fr/fr/ermes/membres/detail-cv/profile/eva-delacroix-bastien.html) & [Florence Benoit-Moreau](https://drm.dauphine.fr/fr/ermes/membres/detail-cv/profile/florence-benoit-moreau.html), DRM-HERMES

### Abstract

In the field of gender studies in marketing, we explore how the market reinforces gender stereotypes through its offer. We manually collected a corpus of products from gender-segmented markets (children's publishing and clothing) and analyzed it with two softwares: Tropes (semantic analysis) and Iramuteq (textual data analysis). We now want to take our research a step further and would like to systematize data collection and analysis in order to strengthen the validity of our conclusions.
